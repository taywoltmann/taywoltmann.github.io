<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Taylor Woltmann. I am from Long Island, NY. I come from a big Italian family. I have an older brother and a younger sister. I am very close to both of my siblings and my parents. Family means everything to me.
</p>
<p id ="more1-p" class="hidden">I have a lot of hobbies. My favorites being yoga, nature walks, and going to the beach. I am a yoga instructor so I spend a lot of time practicing yoga on my own and teaching classes. I love to go on walks in nature and bring my dog Milo. Nature grounds me and helps me stay connected with myself. Lastly, I grew up on the water my whole life. Being near the water is very important to me, whether that is by going to the beach or going on the boat. I have a lot of hobbies, but the most important ones all tend to deal with nature or being outside.

<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
<p>I am currently an undergraduate Biology student. My passion is holistic medicine and healing the body as a whole with earths medicine. I am currently certified as a yoga instructor and reiki practitioner. However, over the next few months I am planning on being certified in holisitc nutrition and herbal medicine.
</p>
<p id ="more2-p" class="hidden">My dream is to open a wellness center for women. Within my wellness center I would love to offer reiki, acupuncture, nutritional counseling, and herbal medicine to cure infertility or hormonal imbalances among women. I would also love to have a yoga studio attached to my wellness center as well and offer yoga classes of all levels, pilates, meditation, and sound healing classes. Hopefully soon I can turn my dream into a reality.
